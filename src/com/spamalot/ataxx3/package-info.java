/**
 * Play the game of Ataxx.
 * <p>
 * Called this Ataxx3 because Ataxxs 1 and 2 turned out to not work too well.
 * <p>
 * In Ataxx1 I made the mistake of trying to optimize too early and wound up
 * with a mess of spaghetti code.
 * <p>
 * With Ataxx2 I tried to add a lot of bells and whistles, like threading,
 * before having a working game. Again, a refactoring mess.
 * <p>
 * Ataxx3 is intended to be as simple as possible, and then refactored from
 * there, then optimized and enhanced.
 * <p>
 * Who am I kidding? There will probably be an Ataxx4.
